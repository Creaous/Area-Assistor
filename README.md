# MineCalc

A mod that ports my Java Application, MineCalc, into Minecraft as a client-side mod! Currently supports 1.19.4!
This is also my first attempt at a Minecraft Mod, and as such, I would not be surprised if there are bugs.

# How to use

To start, open the MineCalc GUI using the key 0 (Default Bind)

The tabs at the top relate to different services of the mod. Currently, there are three services: Set Values, Area Value, and Area Calculation

## Set Values
Select blocks by looking at them, and once all three blocks are selected, the area of the region will be calculated!

## Area Value
This will show the value of the area selected using the Set Values service!

## Area Calculation
This will calculate how many pickaxes/shovels will be required to clear out the area selected using the Set Values service after setting what level of Unbreaking is on your tool! For this service to work, you must be holding a pickaxe or shovel in your hand before opening the GUI!
