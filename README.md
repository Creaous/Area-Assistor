# MineCalc

A mod that ports my Java Application, MineCalc, into Minecraft as a client-side mod! Currently supports 1.19.2!

# How to use

To start, open the MineCalc GUI using the key 0 (Default Bind) (put picture here)

The tabs at the top relate to different services of the mod. Currently, there are three services: Block Selector, Area Value, and Area Calculation (put picture here)

## Block Selector
Select blocks by looking at them, and once all three blocks are selected, the area will be calculated! (put picture here)

## Area Value
This will show the value of the area selected using the Block Selector service! (put picture here)

## Area Calculation
This will calculate how many pickaxes/shovels will be required to clear out the area selected using the Block Selector service! (put picture here)

For this service to work, you must be holding a pickaxe or shovel in your hand before opening the GUI!
